## ✍️ Welcome Message Template (Telegram)

> Hey frens! 👋  
> Welcome to the official [Project Name] TG.  
> Start here:
> 1. Read pinned messages  
> 2. Don’t click random links or DMs  
> 3. Join our Discord for quests & updates

Let’s build together 🚀  
/ Mod Team

> 🔒 **Tip:** Disable DMs from strangers (especially fake "support" scams)

## ✍️ Welcome Message Template (Discord)

> 👋 Welcome to [Project Name]!  
> Here’s how to get started:
> ✅ Verify in #start-here  
> 📌 Check #announcements  
> 🎯 Join #quests or #community-chat to earn/engage  
> ❌ Never trust DMs — mods don’t DM first

We’re glad you’re here 🙌

## ⚠️ Common Red Flags for New Users

- ❌ “You’ve won!” messages in DMs  
- ❌ Fake “Support” accounts asking for seed phrases  
- ❌ Suspicious airdrop links (check announcements first)  
- ❌ Verified badges that look fake or low-quality

## 🧠 Community Mod Best Practices

- Pin real tasks (e.g., verify, join Zealy, mint page)  
- Respond to first-time messages (helps users feel seen)  
- Use reaction-based verification to block bots  
- Schedule weekly intro reminders for newcomers

---

## ✅ Soft Tips for Trust Building

- Keep tone friendly, not robotic  
- Use emojis & casual phrasing  
- Link to safety FAQ (if available)  
- Celebrate milestones publicly (e.g., “Congrats @user for reaching Level 2!”)
