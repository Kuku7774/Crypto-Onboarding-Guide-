# 🛠️ How to Set Up a Web3 Wallet (Safe & Easy)

A wallet is your passport to the crypto world — it lets you send, receive, and store tokens. Let’s get you started!

---

## 🦊 1. Choose Your Wallet

For browser:
- MetaMask (Ethereum + EVM chains)
- Rabby (EVM + security tips built-in)

For mobile:
- Trust Wallet
- Phantom (for Solana)
- OKX Wallet (multi-chain)

> 🔐 **Tip:** Always download from official websites or app stores — no Google ads, no shady links.

---

## 🛠️ 2. Install & Create Wallet

- Download extension or app  
- Click “Create New Wallet”  
- Set a strong password (not reused from elsewhere)  
- You’ll get a **secret recovery phrase** (seed phrase)

---

## 🧠 3. Backup Your Seed Phrase

- Write it down on paper (never screenshot!)  
- Store in a safe place — not online, not in email, not in Google Drive  
- Don't share with anyone — not even “support staff”

> ⚠️ Anyone with your seed phrase can steal all your assets.

---

## 🌐 4. Connect to a dApp (website)

- Visit a Web3 site (e.g. Uniswap, OpenSea, Zealy)  
- Click “Connect Wallet” → Choose your wallet  
- Approve the connection

> ✅ Always check the URL — don’t connect your wallet on random sites.

---

## 🔐 5. Extra Safety Tips

- Use **hardware wallet** (like Ledger) for big amounts  
- Create a “burner wallet” for testing new dApps  
- Always double-check approvals on sites like revoke.cash

---

## 💡 Bonus: Understand "Sign Message" vs "Send Transaction"

- **Sign Message** = Login (safe)  
- **Send Transaction** = Money moves (gas fees involved)

If confused, stop and research before clicking!
