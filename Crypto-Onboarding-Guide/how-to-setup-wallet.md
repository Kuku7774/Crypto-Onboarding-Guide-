# 🛠️ How to Set Up a Web3 Wallet (Safely & Easily)

A wallet is like your Web3 passport — it lets you store tokens, use dApps, and prove your on-chain identity. Here’s how to set it up without stress.

---

## 🦊 1. Pick the Right Wallet

For browser (desktop):
- MetaMask – most used for Ethereum & EVM chains  
- Rabby – safer option with better transaction preview

For mobile:
- Trust Wallet – multi-chain  
- Phantom – best for Solana  
- OKX Wallet – good all-rounder

> 🔒 Tip: Always install from official links — not ads or “helpful” DMs.

## 🔐 2. Install and Create Wallet

- Download the wallet (extension or app)  
- Click **“Create new wallet”**  
- Set a strong password (avoid using your name or birth year)  
- You’ll get a **Secret Recovery Phrase** (a.k.a. seed phrase)

---

## 🧠 3. Back Up the Seed Phrase

- Write it down on paper (not in Notes app or screenshots)  
- Store it offline in a safe spot  
- Never share it — not even with “support” teams or bots

> ❗ Whoever has your seed phrase has full access to your wallet.

---

## 🌐 4. Connect to a dApp

- Visit a Web3 site (like Uniswap, Zealy, OpenSea)  
- Click “Connect Wallet” → choose your wallet  
- Approve the connection

> ✅ Make sure the site URL is correct — phishing sites look *almost* identical.

## 🧰 5. Extra Safety Tips

- Use a hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger) for big balances  
- Make a second wallet for airdrops/testing  
- Clean up approvals regularly at [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)  
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi when signing transactions

---

## 🧾 Bonus: "Sign" vs "Send"

- **Sign Message** = login/authentication (safe, no funds move)  
- **Send Transaction** = crypto moves out + gas fee involved

> If you’re unsure what a signature will do — stop and check.
